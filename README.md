## About Me

I am an advanced Electronic Engineering student with a passion for robotics, embedded systems, and software development. Currently, I am completing my degree with a focus on digital systems and autonomous robotics. My academic and practical experiences include developing autonomous surface vehicles, working with ROS, and programming in Python, C++, and Matlab.

I thrive in collaborative environments where I can apply my technical skills to real-world problems and continuously learn new technologies. I am eager to contribute to projects that combine hardware and software innovation.

## Featured Projects üöÄ

Here are some of the projects I‚Äôve developed to explore robotics, algorithms, and simulation.  
Each project is an opportunity to apply theoretical concepts into practical implementations, combining programming, visualization, and system design.


### Maze Generator

An interactive visualization tool for generating mazes using multiple algorithms. The project allows users to explore different generation methods, control the animation speed, and customize grid size for experimentation.

**Key Features:**
- Implements **DFS**, **Prim‚Äôs Algorithm**, and **Recursive Division**.
- Real-time **visualization** using **Pygame**.
- User controls for **algorithm selection** and **maze parameters**.
- Designed as an **educational tool** to understand algorithmic behavior.

**Technologies:** Python, Pygame
